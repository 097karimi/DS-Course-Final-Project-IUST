# DS-Course-Final-Project-IUST

Distributed Systems Project - University of IUST

This repository hosts my Distributed Systems Project for the Fall 2024 term at the University of IUST. The project focuses on designing and implementing a Real-Time Financial Analysis & Trading System using distributed systems principles.



üìñ Project Overview

This project involves developing a scalable, distributed system that processes and analyzes simulated financial data in real-time. The system is designed to generate actionable trading signals through the integration of microservices, stream processing, and real-time data visualization.

Key Components:

1. Data Generator Script: Simulates financial data from multiple sources.
2. Data Ingestion Service: Receives, validates, and forwards data.
3. Stream Processing Service: Analyzes data and calculates trading indicators.
4. Trading Signal Service: Generates buy/sell signals.
5. Notification Service: Sends instant alerts on trading signals.
6. Visualization Service: Displays processed data and trading signals.
7. Load Balancer: Manages incoming traffic across servers.
8. Aggregator Service: Summarizes stock performance.




üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

The project employs:

Microservices Architecture

Stream Processing for real-time data handling

Websockets for live updates

Load Balancing to handle high traffic

Visualization using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.



üìä Mandatory Trading Indicators

The system computes the following financial indicators:

1. Moving Average: Identifies trend directions.


2. Exponential Moving Average: Reacts quickly to price changes.


3. Relative Strength Index (RSI): Determines market overbought/oversold conditions.





üöÄ Workflow

1. Data Generation: Simulated financial data creation.


2. Data Ingestion: Validation and forwarding of data.


3. Stream Processing: Calculation of indicators in real time.


4. Signal Generation: Production of actionable trading signals.


5. Notification: Alerts sent to users.


6. Data Aggregation: Summarization of stock data.


7. Visualization: Real-time display on a user-friendly dashboard.





üîß Getting Started
